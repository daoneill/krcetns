    "message": "Welcome to Killester Raheny Clontarf (KRC) ETNS school website, where you can explore what life is like in our wonderful school. Since opening our doors in September 2019 with 7 Junior Infant pupils, we have grown each year, and we now cater for pupils up to 3rd class. We were delighted to open 2 full Autism Classes in September 2023; and by September 2026, we will have all classes from Junior Infants to 6th Class.\n\nWe are an Educate Together school, which means that we are equality-based, democratically-run, child-centred, and co-educational. The mottos of Educate Together are ‘No Child an Outsider’ and ‘Learn Together to Live Together,’ and we seek to ensure that these are embedded in our school culture in authentic and tangible ways.\n\nCelebrating diversity for us means that every child, parent/guardian and staff member feels like they genuinely belong. While we have high expectations for our pupils, we recognise that children can only learn and reach their unique potential in a nurturing school environment where they feel that they are respected for who they are, cared for, safe, and where they feel they can explore and express their own identity in a warm and secure space.\n\nWe have been incredibly fortunate in the staff we have attracted since we opened. Everyone working in the school is fully committed to developing and maintaining a genuinely egalitarian, anti-racist, caring, honest, respectful, and compassionate school. We now have 25 people on our team, including our bus drivers, escorts and catering assistant; and everyone plays a vital role in ensuring the children’s happiness, security, and sense of worth. It is through this collaborative approach that we can nurture the children’s ability to become the best possible versions of their wonderfully unique selves.\n\nAs a school committed to the value of democracy, we welcome and support the proactive involvement of the Parents Association in our school’s activities.\n\nEnjoy exploring our school website, which will give you a brief snapshot of our fantastic school community. Should you have any queries please do not hesitate to get in touch with myself or Joanne (school secretary) at: info.krcetns@gmail.com"

    "title": "Our Ethos and Values",
    "main_content": "Since opening our doors in 2019, we in Killester Raheny Clontarf (KRC) ETNS have been dedicated to ensuring that our school is genuinely inclusive of all the wonderful diversity that makes up our ever-changing community. With this in mind, we are committed to living by and actively promoting the values and principles of the Educate Together Charter (equality-based, co-educational, child-centred and democratically-run), and those of our Anti-Racism and Restorative Practice Statements. We strive to embed these values and principles in all dimensions of school life.\n\nBeing a restorative school means that our core focus is on how we develop and maintain relationships. The relationships between all members of our school community are vital in terms of developing a genuinely warm and welcoming environment. Developing a strong bond between the children and adults in the school is central to all that we do. It is our aim that every child in our school feels included and that they belong. We recognise that feeling included and having a real sense of belonging is not the responsibility of the child but of the entire school community, and that a child can only feel that they belong in an environment that is one of authentic inclusion and respect.\n\nEvery child has the right to feel safe, valued and respected, and to have their voices heard. Children learn best when they feel like they belong, and where they can develop and become their authentic selves without fear of judgement or ridicule. We want the children in our school to feel comfortable being themselves, but equally we want the children to respect each other's diversity in a caring, loving, respectful and anti-racist environment. Children are encouraged to see uniqueness and difference as being an everyday part of being in the world with others. This demands that everyone in the school community is committed to ensuring that the diversity that exists in our school is accepted as part of what makes up the fabric of our community and that all children are cherished for what they uniquely bring to our ever-changing, ever-developing school.\n\nWe want people to feel the character and spirit of our school community as they step through our doors. As we grow and develop, we will ensure that this atmosphere of respect, inclusion, kindness and anti-racism remains central to what we do and how we do it.\n\nWith this in mind, the whole school team is committed to ensuring that representing diverse identities is something that is normalised within our delivery of the curriculum, within the school's policies, and in how we engage with each other. We recognise that the curriculum privileges some identities, experiences and perspectives over others. To redress this inequity, we strive to ensure balanced representation as far as possible. To this end, we implement a curriculum where children see their own and other people's diverse identities reflected in teaching materials. We do not shy away from difficult issues or conversations, but instead engage children in reflective and respectful dialogue in an age-appropriate way.\n\nOur ethos is not just a statement, but a living document that we revisit regularly to ensure that our values are reflected in what we do, and why and how we do it. Making a school genuinely inclusive and anti-racist demands that everyone regularly reflects on their individual practice, how the curriculum is delivered, how we speak to each other, how conflict is dealt with, etc. We endeavour to ensure that our curriculum plans, policies, and other documents reflect our values. We also know that inclusivity extends beyond these and is to be found in the little things we do and how we engage with each other every day.",
